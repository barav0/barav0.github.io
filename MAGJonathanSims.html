<h1>Jonathan Sims</h1>
    <p>
    Jonathan "Jon" Sims appears as the main protagonist of <a href="https://rustyquill.com/show/the-magnus-archives/" target=”_blank”>Rusty Quill</a>´s <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/5pwBAjuJJAOt7cED5Lkjnk" target=”_blank”>Magnus Archives</a>. 
    After Gertude Robinson´s death he takes on the role of the head archivist (or The Archivist &#x1F441;) of The Magnus Institude &#x1F5AD;. The role of The Archivist also makes him the avatar of The Eye. And throughout the developing story it is made clear what that entails.

    <h2>Marks from Entities</h2>
    <p>
      Despite the fact that Jonathan Sims is an avatar of The Eye (or The Watcher) he has also been marked in one way or another by every entity. "Marks" are encounters with entities or their avatars which take the form of scars, injuries, or interactions. Almost every one of Jon´s marks has been orchestrated by Elias Bouchard.
