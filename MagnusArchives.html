<h1>Lore</h1>
    <p> They are various aspects of an amorphous force of fear that exists next to our reality. They are variously also referred to as Gods, powers, or simply as the Fears. Their influence upon reality manifests as supernatural happenings — all supernatural phenomena in the world are simply extensions of them. These phenomena can take various forms such as people, animals, monsters, books, objects, or places, all with the goal of evoking fear, terror, and paranoia from all who encounter them. </br> </p>
    <p> These entities do not simply feed off of fear but are fears made manifest. It is not only human fear that counts but that of animals as well, particularly for The Flesh and The Hunt. The more fearful the world is of a certain thing, the more powerful the related entity becomes, becoming empowered by the increased fear of its realm of influence. </p>
    <p>
     They have been divided by Robert Smirk into 14 main categories. These are as follows: </p>
    <ol type="disc"> 
        <li><strong>The Buried</strong> - fear of small spaces</li>
        <li><strong>The Corruption</strong> - fear of desease, filth</li>
        <li><strong>The Dark</strong> - fear of the dark, of what lies beyond that we cannot see</li>
        <li><strong>The Desolation</strong> - fear of pain, loss, burning, and destruction especially with senseless cause</li>
        <li><strong>The End</strong> - fear of death itself- uncaring and inevitable</li>
        <li><strong>The Eye</strong> - fear of being watched, followed, having secrets exposed</li>
        <li><strong>The Flesh</strong> - fear held by animals of being bred for meat, and in the human realisation- that we are just animated meat and bones</li>
        <li><strong>The Hunt</strong> - the animalistic fear of being chased or hunted; fear of being prey</li>
        <li><strong>The Lonely</strong> - fear of isolation, of being completely cut off and alone or disconnected from society</li>
        <li><strong>The Slaughter</strong> - fear of pure, unpredictable, unmotivated violence; fear pain coming at sudden, random moments</li>
        <li><strong>The Spiral</strong> - fear of madness, that the world you know is wrong, that your mind is lying to you; fear of deception, lying, deceiving of mind and senses</li>
        <li><strong>The Stranger</strong> - the fear of the unknown, the unfamiliar; the creeping sense that something is not right</li>
        <li><strong>The Vast</strong> - the fear of heights, falling, and large open spaces including sky, space, and deep water; more broadly: the human fear of insignificance and meaninglessness</li>
        <li><strong>The Web</strong> - the fear of being controlled or trapped, especially being unaware of one´s own entrapment; the fear of being forced to do things against one´s own will, of being manipulated; also the fear of spiders</li>
    </ol>
    <p> Dekker´s list of entities also included a new category:</p>
    <ol type="disc">
        <li><strong>The Extinction</strong> - the fear of catastrophic change, destruction of nature, destruction of human skin and tissue, the destruction of humanity itself and its´ replacement by something different; all of this especially via mankind´s own causing</li>
    </ol>
